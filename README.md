Becodiante the great

Welcome adventurer, monster or whatever you are.
We are reaching the end of the JavaScript course, but no worries: it does not end here. There are so many things to discover, so many things to touch. Don't let it scare you because it is so much fun in the end!

This "last" challenge will test your knowledge about JavaScript. If you're struggling, that's fine. Just don't forget to ask your colleagues for help!

Who am I?
I am Becodiante The Great, a powerfull wizard in search of the strongest JavaScript gurus alive.

Let...
me take a proper look at you... Aha, I see. You might be the right fit for this challenge! Although you will have to team up with someone.

Before we begin...
I have given you a magical script that must be used to create your avatar!
OH right... Your instructions. * Coughs *.
You and your colleague have to program a game where you can battle each other. The players can use buttons to define which move he/she will make next. The game shall only end when a player reaches 0 health.

Don't worry I shall guide you and help you on your way.

The stats
Game example (It does not have to look like this!).
Each calculation should run for one attack. For instance, if I have a bow and decide to attack. I might get lucky and strike twice. If the opponent wears boots, he could dodge the attack twice, once or never.

ITEMS	Boots	Staff	Sword	Bow
30% chance to dodge an attack	20% increase in healing	30% more damage	30% chance to attack twice
RACE	Humans	Orcs	Elves	Vampires
20% less damage taken	40% more max health	30% chance to deflect the attack back to the opponent. The attacker takes damage equal to 50% of the original hit. The elf takes no damage.	10% lifesteal from opponents current health at start of the vampire's turn.
ATTENTION
In the character.js file, you can define what effects will take place on certain events. If the player is an orc and if he/she has boots, the stats will take effect straight on creation.

I also expect you to randomize the healing and attack function. Feel free to edit the script to your likings.

Journey 1 will have more visual related challenges, journey 2 will have more gamelogic related challenges.

Journey 1 - Player 1
Starts here!
Journey 2 - Player 2
Starts here!
The Boss
We are almost finished. There are still some things to tackle.

Here is a list of what you should work out:

Combine the code + html for some 'working result'.
Inputs should generate the characters stats.
Work out the attack function (Almost the same as heal but it has to hit the enemy).
When a player loses, display a victory message & a loose message for each player.
At the end of the game, you should be able to restart the game to create a new character.
The final encounter
Style this arena to your taste.
Add extra functions. (Keep it appropriate.)
Prepare to present your work.
Well done! Now challenge people!
Goals
 Understand DOM manipulation.
 Understand forms input.
 Understand JSON.
 Understand basic javascript
 Have extra fun!
